## Background ðŸ“–

[applyboard-img]:https://didmdw8v48h5q.cloudfront.net/ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/New-2018-AB.png
At ApplyBoard, we believe that education is a right, not a privilege. We empower people around the world to access the best education available. Our platform streamlines the application process from submission to enrolment assisting thousands of students to pursue their dreams of studying abroad.

## Problem ðŸ–¥

At ApplyBoard we utilize event sourcing to store changes in our system so that we can replay, undo or redo some event that happened in the past. The given question is to build a system that supports these functionalities.

To simplify the problem, we need to build it for the given requirements:

Given an initial integer value of 0, we need a system to track, add and subtract the value. Additionally, we need to build upon our event tracking to support undo, redo, bulk_undo and bulk_redo functionalities.

We have created a base EventSourcer class that holds an initial value of 0, alongside function signatures as a base, it will be your job to implement the functions. Feel free to add other functions, however do not change the function signatures or the constructor as it will fail the tests.

If you are looking for more details on how the undo/redo functionality should work, check out this video at the timestamp linked: https://youtu.be/X6NJkWbM1xk?t=173 . The implementation we are looking for is the first simple solution mentioned!

**You will have until July 10th 3:00pm to submit your Pull Requests**

## Method Signatures
To complete the challenge, implement the following functions:

```
add(num: integer)
  - add num to the value

subtract(num: integer)
  - subtract num from the value

undo()
  - revert last event

redo()
  - redo next event

bulk_undo(amount: integer)
  - undo the given amount of events

bulk_redo(amount: integer)
  - redo the given amount of events
```

## Example

```
initial_value = 0

add(20)
value: 20

add(30)
value: 50

subtract(10)
value: 40

undo()
value: 50

redo()
value: 40

redo()
value: 40 (Nothing to redo)

bulk_undo(2) (The last two actions were subtract(10) and add(30))
value: 20

bulk_redo(2)
value: 40

```

### JavaScript
#### Writing your solution
1. Open the `javascript_solution.js` file.
2. Implement the `add` `subtract` `undo` `redo` `bulk_undo` and `bulk_redo` functions

#### Testing your solution
